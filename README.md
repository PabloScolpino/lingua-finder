This is a custom web scraper, that piggybacks on google custom search engine to find pages of interest. The pages found are downloaded, and parsed looking for custom (and complex) search criterias.

## Please check out the live system:

* The official [production environment](https://linguafinder.herokuapp.com/) (if you can't tell the difference, this is the one you want)
* The [test environment](https://linguafinder-staging.herokuapp.com/) (that may be broken at any given time)
