# LinguaFinder [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/PabloScolpino/lingua-finder/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/PabloScolpino/lingua-finder?branch=master)

This is a custom web scraper, that piggybacks on google custom search engine to find pages of interest. The pages found are downloaded, and parsed looking for custom (and complex) search criterias.

## Please check out the live system:

`This project was left unatended for a long time, and it is partly broken, I am in the process of updating it`

* The [test environment](https://linguafinder-staging.herokuapp.com/) (that may be broken at any given time)
